            <h2>Rethinking reality</h2>
            <p>Scientists are like prospectors, excavating the natural world seeking gems of knowledge <br> about physical reality. And in the century just past, scientists have dug deep enough to <br> discover that reality’s foundations do not mirror the world of everyday appearances. At its <br> roots, reality is described by the mysterious set of mathematical rules known as quantum <br> mechanics.</p>

            <p>Conceived at the turn of the 20th century and then emerging in its full form in the mid- <br> 1920s, quantum mechanics is the math that explains matter. It’s the theory for describing <br> the physics of the microworld, where atoms and molecules interact to generate the world <br> of human experience. And it’s at the heart of everything that made the century just past so <br> dramatically unlike the century preceding it. From cell phones to supercomputers, DVDs to <br> pdfs, quantum physics fueled the present-day electronics-based economy, transforming <br> commerce, communication and entertainment.<br> <br> But quantum theory taught scientists much more than how to make computer chips. It <br> taught that reality isn’t what it seems. </p>

            <p>“The fundamental nature of reality could be radically different from our familiar world of <br> objects moving around in space and interacting with each other,” physicist Sean Carroll <br> suggested in a recent tweet. “We shouldn’t fool ourselves into mistaking the world as we <br> experience it for the world as it really is.” <br> <br>In a technical paper backing up his tweet, Carroll notes that quantum theory consists of <br> equations that describe mathematical entities roaming through an abstract realm of <br> possible natural events. It’s plausible, Carroll argues, that this quantum realm of <br> mathematical possibilities represents the true, fundamental nature of reality. If so, all the <br> physical phenomena we perceive are just a “higher-level emergent description” of what’s <br> really going on. <br> <br>
                “Emergent” events in ordinary space are real in their own way, just not fundamental, Carroll <br> allows. Belief that the “spatial arena” is fundamental “is more a matter of convenience and <br> convention than one of principle,” he says. <br> <br>
                Carroll’s perspective is not the only way of viewing the meaning of quantum math, he <br> acknowledges, and it is not fully shared by most physicists. But everybody does agree that quantum <br> physics has drastically remodeled humankind’s understanding of nature. In fact, a <br> fair reading of history suggests that quantum theory is the most dramatic shift in science’s <br> conception of reality since the ancient Greeks deposed mythological explanations of natural <br> phenomena in favor of logic and reason. After all, quantum physics itself seems to defy logic <br> and reason.
